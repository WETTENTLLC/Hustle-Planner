  {
    question: "Is my data secure? Who can see my information?",
    answer: "Your privacy is our top priority. All data is stored locally on your device using browser storage. Nothing is transmitted to any serversâ€”there are no accounts, no logins, and no data collection. Only you can see your information."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this planner on multiple devices?",
    answer: "Currently, data doesn't sync between devices since everything is stored locally for privacy. We recommend using the planner on your primary device. We're exploring options for secure, encrypted cross-device syncing in the future."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I lose my data if I clear my browser history/cache?",
    answer: "Yes, clearing browser storage or cache will remove your planner data. Consider using the export function to periodically save your data as a backup. You can then import this data back if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How do reminders work if there's no cloud service?",
    answer: "Reminders use your browser's built-in notification system. They'll work even when the tab isn't active, but the browser needs to be running. For important reminders, we recommend also setting a backup in your phone's alarm app."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this app free to use? Are there premium features?",
    answer: "Secure the Bag is completely free with no premium tier or subscription. We believe in providing privacy-focused tools for the dancer community without financial barriers. If you find it useful, consider sharing it with others."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I suggest new features or improvements?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We built this tool based on real dancer needs and welcome your feedback. Use the contact link in the footer to send us feature requests or improvement suggestions. We're continuously enhancing the planner."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I delete all my data if I want to start over?",
    answer: "Go to each section and use the delete/clear functions provided. Alternatively, you can completely reset by clearing your browser's local storage for this site (this will remove ALL data, so export anything you want to keep first)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this app designed specifically for exotic dancers?",
    answer: "Yes, Secure the Bag was designed with the specific needs of exotic dancers in mind. However, many features are useful for other night workers, performers, or anyone with irregular income patterns who values privacy."
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't you have a mobile app in the app stores?",
    answer: "Our web app approach allows anyone to access the planner without downloading anything or creating accounts. It also avoids app store restrictions on adult industry-adjacent tools. For a mobile experience, you can add this site to your home screen."
  },
  {
    question: "The reminders aren't working for me. What should I do?",
    answer: "First, ensure you've granted notification permissions. On mobile, notifications can be less reliable due to system restrictions. Make sure the browser remains running in the background. For critical reminders, we recommend setting backup alarms."
